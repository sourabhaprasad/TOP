                Twenty One Pilots (often stylized as twenty one pilots or TWENTY ØNE PILØTS) is an American 
                musical duo that originates from Columbus, Ohio. The band was founded by lead singer 
                Tyler Joseph in 2009 along with former members Nick Thomas and Chris Salih who left in 2011. 
                The band's current line up features Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. In 2009 and 2011 they 
                released two albums, Twenty One Pilots and Regional at Best. The band eventually signed 
                a record deal with label Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Under this label the band 
                released their first major release, Vessel, in 2013, followed by their second and 
                most successful album, Blurryface, in 2015. In 2018, after one year on hiatus, the 
                band released their fifth album, Trench. In 2021, following the established storyline on 
                Trench, they released their sixth studio album, Scaled and Icy.

                    <p>Twenty One Pilots use a variety of instruments including piano, synthesizer, drums, vocals, 
                        and the ukulele. The band has revealed on the website reddit that they do not have guitar 
                        featured on any of their music due to the fact that neither Joseph nor Dun can play.
                        The songs are often poetry based, and Joseph has stated that if the poetry is too long he 
                        will start rapping to fit them in. The band span many genres and are generally difficult
                        to assign. However, they have referred to themselves as schizophrenic pop, 
                        an unofficial subgenre of pop.All members of the band, past and present, 
                        identify as Christian, and many of the songs contain allusions to and messages 
                        about Christian theology and God. However, the band is not itself considered a 
                        Christian band and enjoys mainstream exposure.

                    <h4 class="section-header2">Under the band's biography on their website, the band also explained one of their missions.</h4>
                    <p>
                        "Basically, we are all responsible for the preservation of our personal joy; 
                        but happiness is different. Joy is not circumstantial, happiness is. 
                        You can be depressed and still have joy. You can be suicidal and still have joy. 
                        We all stop thinking and we all stop talking and we all stop sharing and we all stop
                        creating, because by doing any of these things we quickly find out just how unhappy 
                        we are. But that’s okay. That’s normal. Don’t let the fear of unhappiness cripple 
                        your pursuit of finding what it is you believe. Since joy is found in belief, we all 
                        have to push through unhappiness to find joy."
